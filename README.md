# 🌍 World-Database-Analysis-MySQL-Project

This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to explore and analyze the [MySQL "World" sample database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html). The queries cover a variety of topics such as population statistics, language distribution, capital cities, and GDP insights.

## 📁 File

* **`classwork.sql`** – A set of SQL queries used for data exploration and analysis based on the `city`, `country`, and `countrylanguage` tables.

## 📊 Features

The SQL queries in this project perform the following tasks:

* 🔍 Retrieve all data from the main tables (`city`, `country`, `countrylanguage`)
* 🇺🇸 Count the number of distinct districts in the USA
* 🌱 Identify the country with the highest life expectancy
* 🏙️ Search for cities with names containing "new"
* 🏆 List the 10 most populated cities
* 📈 Filter cities by population ranges (e.g., over 2 million, between 500k and 1 million)
* 🅱️ Find cities starting with "Be"
* 🔡 List cities alphabetically
* 📉 Identify the most and least populated cities/countries
* 🏛️ Retrieve the capital city of Spain
* 🌍 List countries and their cities in Europe
* 🧮 Compute average population per country
* 📉 List countries with low population density
* 💰 Calculate GDP per capita by city
* 🔢 Paginate query results (e.g., rows 31–40)

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* Practice with `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`
* Use aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `AVG`, and calculated columns
* Apply filtering using `WHERE`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`

## 🛠️ Setup

To run the SQL queries:

1. Install MySQL Server locally or use an online SQL editor that supports the World database.
2. Download and import the World database from the official MySQL site.
3. Open `classwork.sql` in your SQL IDE or command line and run the queries.

## 📌 Notes

* Some queries may include small syntax issues or typos (e.g., double titles in column aliases). Feel free to modify them as needed.
* The dataset used is for educational purposes and may not represent up-to-date real-world data.
